Example of shopping cart implemented in react.js and redux.js

## details
- build with [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Check their page for more details.
- this example is using redux.js for application state management, to learn more about it I recommend [this tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux).
- you can look under the hood directly from your browser using [redux devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension). Install extension for your browser, open demo page (link above) and see how app state changes when you interact with it.
